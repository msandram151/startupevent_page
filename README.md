<h1>The Biggest Startup Event - Join NOW!</h1> <br>
<p><strong>Just kidding</strong>. It's a webpage I've created while following one of <strong>the ZTM course</strong>. I've enetered section with <strong>Bootstrap</strong>. 
One thing I've noticed is that the videos are a bit <i>outdated</i>. You know, I understand it's because of the latest <strong>Bootstrap</strong> updates and stuff.
Up to <strong>2023</strong> the course was fine but once we entered <strong>2024</strong> it became a <i>legacy</i>. It's good to follow his courses, still but it will be best to add to them resources like: <i>W3CSchool</i>, <i>Freetocodecamp.org</i>, etc.
Don't relly on one source.</p>
