The Biggest Startup Event - Join NOW! <br>
Just kidding. It's a webpage I've created while following one of the ZTM courses. I've enetered section with bootstrap. 
One thing I've noticed is that the videos are a bit outdated. You know, I understand it's because of the latest Bootstrap updates and stuff.
Up to 2023 the course was fine but once we entered 2024 it became a legacy. It's good to follow his courses, still but it will be best to add to them resources like W3CSchool, Freetocodecamp.org, etc.
Don't relly on one source.
